    Research and analyze the Top 10 list: "{topic}"

    Your task is to identify the definitive Top 10 items for this topic and research
    each one thoroughly. For EACH of the 10 items, provide:

    1. RANKING: Clear position (1-10) with brief explanation of why it ranks there
    2. KEY FACTS: 3-4 fascinating, specific facts with numbers, dates, or statistics
    3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS: What makes this item special or different
    4. SURPRISING ELEMENT: One unexpected or little-known fact that will surprise viewers
    5. NARRATION FOCUS: The ONE specific fact/moment that will be the main focus in the narration (this will guide image generation)
    6. VISUAL CONTEXT: Simple description of the visual moment that shows the narration focus (max 8 words)

    Research Requirements:
    - Use current, accurate data from reliable sources (last 2 years preferred)
    - Include specific numbers, statistics, percentages when possible
    - Find unique angles that aren't commonly known
    - Consider: beauty, cultural significance, impact, uniqueness, or relevance to the topic
    - Verify facts are accurate and defensible
    - For narration_focus: Choose the MOST interesting/surprising fact that deserves visual representation
    - For visual_context: Describe a specific moment/scene that shows this fact (e.g., "construction in 1889" not "beautiful architecture")

    Output Format:
    Return a JSON object with this structure:
    {{
      "topic": "Top 10 [topic name]",

generate_image_prompts:
  description: >
    Create SHORT, CONTEXTUAL, REALISTIC image prompts for each of the 10 items in: "{topic}"

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Keep prompts SHORT (maximum 10-15 words)
    2. Use the item's "visual_context" from research to create contextual prompts
    3. Combine: item name + visual_context to show the specific narration moment
    4. NO artistic style words (cinematic, majestic, breathtaking, etc.)
    5. NO technical terms (8K, ultra detailed, award-winning, etc.)
    6. NO mood/atmosphere descriptions
    7. Just describe what should be photographed simply and directly

    Research Data (includes visual_context for each item):
    {research_data}

    STRATEGY:
    - Each research item has "visual_context" - USE THIS to create the prompt
    - Format: "[Item Name] [visual_context]"
    - This ensures images match the narration focus

    GOOD Examples (using visual_context):
    - "Eiffel Tower under construction in 1889" (shows narration about World's Fair)
    - "Golden Gate Bridge during 1937 opening ceremony" (shows historical moment)
    - "Mount Everest first summit expedition 1953" (shows achievement context)
    - "Venice canal flooding in acqua alta" (shows specific phenomenon)
    - "Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching damage" (shows environmental angle)

    BAD Examples (generic or too artistic):
    - "Eiffel Tower in Paris during daytime" (too generic, misses narration context)
    - "Majestic Golden Gate Bridge bathed in golden sunset" (artistic, not contextual)
    - "Stunning aerial view of Mount Everest, 8K resolution" (technical jargon)

    Output Format:
    {{
      "theme": "contextual realistic photography",
      "prompts": [
        {{
          "rank": 1,
          "name": "Item Name",
          "prompt": "Item name plus visual_context (max 15 words)",
          "style_notes": "realistic photograph"
        }},
        ... (for all 10 items)
      ]
    }}

    IMPORTANT: Use the visual_context from research data. Keep prompts SHORT, SIMPLE, and CONTEXTUAL. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text.
  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with SHORT, CONTEXTUAL, REALISTIC image prompts for all 10 items.
    Each prompt should combine item name with visual_context from research (max 10-15 words total).
